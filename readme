assignment3DM.py was developed and tested using Python version 2.7.6 on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine.

The assignment3DM.py has no dependencies or outside libraries that need to be installed.
Only the sys library was imported in order to retrieve file paths from the command line.
It should be portable to any linux flavored machine with Python version 2.7.6

Usage: python assignment3DM.py training_file testing_file
A makefile is NOT required.
